# Singleton

In Vue.js version 3 with script setup, you can implement the Singleton Design Pattern using the `ref` function to create a reactive reference to the singleton instance. Here's an example of how to do it:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Singleton Component</h1>
    <p>Instance ID: {{ instanceId }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

let instance = ref(null);

// Function to create the singleton instance
function createInstance() {
  instance.value = {
    instanceId: Date.now(), // Generate a unique ID for the instance
  };
}

// Check if an instance already exists
if (!instance.value) {
  createInstance(); // If not, create the instance
}
</script>
```

In this example, we are using the `ref` function to create a reactive reference named `instance` that holds the singleton instance of the component. We then define a function called `createInstance` that creates the singleton instance with a unique ID.

In the script setup section, we check if the `instance.value` is null, indicating that no instance has been created yet. If it is null, we call the `createInstance` function to create the singleton instance.

Now, whenever this component is used in different parts of the application, it will always refer to the same instance created earlier, ensuring the singleton behavior.

Usage of the SingletonComponent in other parts of the application:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <SingletonComponent />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import SingletonComponent from './SingletonComponent.vue';
</script>
```

When `SingletonComponent` is used in other parts of the application, it will always refer to the same instance created earlier, maintaining the singleton behavior across the entire application.
