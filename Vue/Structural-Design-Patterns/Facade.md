# Facade

In Vue.js version 3, the `script setup` syntax provides a more concise way to define components. It allows you to use the Composition API while reducing boilerplate code. When it comes to applying the Facade Design Pattern, you can do so within the `script setup` block.

The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a more complex underlying system. It allows you to present a unified and easy-to-use interface that hides the complexity of the underlying code. In the context of a Vue.js component, you can use the Facade Design Pattern to expose a simplified API to the consumers of the component, abstracting away any internal complexity.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Facade Design Pattern in a Vue.js component using the `script setup` syntax:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Your component template here -->
</template>

<script setup>
  // Import any necessary functions or objects from your component library
  import { doSomething, doAnotherThing } from '@/your-component-library';

  // Expose only the necessary functions or objects to the template
  const { result, isLoading, error } = doSomething();

  // Optionally, you can expose functions that act as facades for the complex behavior
  function doSimpleThing() {
    return doSomething();
  }
</script>
```

In this example, the `doSimpleThing()` function serves as a facade for the `doSomething()` function from the component library. Instead of exposing the `doSomething()` function directly to the template, you provide a simplified version that consumers can use without worrying about the internal implementation details.

Using the Facade Design Pattern in this way can make your component library easier to use and understand, as it hides the complexity of certain operations behind a simpler API.

Remember that the specific implementation of the Facade Design Pattern may vary depending on the structure and complexity of your component library. The key idea is to expose a simplified interface to your components' consumers while encapsulating the underlying complexity.
