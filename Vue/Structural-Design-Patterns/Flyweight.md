# Flyweight

In Vue.js version 3 with the `script setup` syntax, you can apply the Flyweight Design Pattern to optimize the performance and memory usage of your component library.

The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural pattern that aims to reduce memory usage by sharing data that is common across multiple objects. In the context of a component library, this means that you can use the Flyweight pattern to share data or state between instances of a component that have the same properties or configuration.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Flyweight Design Pattern in a Vue.js component using the `script setup` syntax:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your component template here -->
    <p>{{ computedValue }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  // Import any necessary functions or objects from your component library
  import { reactive, toRefs } from 'vue';

  // Shared flyweight data
  const sharedData = reactive({
    commonValue: 'Hello, this is a shared value!',
  });

  // Props
  const { propA, propB } = toRefs(props);

  // Computed property that uses the shared data
  const computedValue = computed(() => {
    // Use sharedData.commonValue along with propA and propB to compute the final value
    return sharedData.commonValue + ' ' + propA.value + ' ' + propB.value;
  });
</script>
```

In this example, the `sharedData` object acts as a flyweight that holds the `commonValue` that is shared among all instances of this component. The individual instances of the component use this shared value in their computed property, along with their own specific `propA` and `propB` values, to generate the final `computedValue`.

By using the Flyweight Design Pattern, you avoid unnecessary duplication of the `commonValue` data across all instances of the component, which can help optimize memory usage, especially when you have many instances of the same component with the same shared properties.

It's important to note that the specific implementation of the Flyweight Design Pattern may vary depending on your component library's requirements and structure. The key idea is to identify shared data or state that can be shared among multiple instances and leverage it to optimize memory usage.
