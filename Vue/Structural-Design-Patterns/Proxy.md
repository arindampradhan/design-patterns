# Proxy

In Vue.js version 3, the script setup syntax makes it even easier to implement the Proxy Design Pattern in a component library. The Proxy Design Pattern allows you to create a surrogate or placeholder object (proxy) that controls access to another object, the target object.

Let's walk through how you can implement the Proxy Design Pattern in a component library using Vue.js version 3 with script setup.

1. Set up the Component Library
First, create a new Vue.js project or navigate to an existing project that serves as your component library.

2. Install Vue.js version 3
Ensure that you have Vue.js version 3 installed in your project. You can install it using npm or yarn.

3. Create the component with script setup
In your component file, you can use the new script setup syntax. The `<script setup>` tag allows you to define your component using a more compact and concise format.

Let's create a simple example of a component library that implements a proxy for a counter:

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, proxy } from 'vue';

const count = ref(0);

// Create a proxy for the count ref
const countProxy = proxy(count);

// Create a method to increment the count
const increment = () => {
  countProxy.value++;
};
</script>
```

In this example, we use the `ref` function to create a reactive reference `count`. Then, we create a proxy using the `proxy` function, which allows us to control access to the `count` ref. The `countProxy` is what we'll expose to the component's consumers.

4. Export the proxy
To make the proxy accessible outside the component, you can export it from the script setup block.

```vue
<script setup>
// ...

// Export the count proxy
export { countProxy as count };
</script>
```

By exporting the `countProxy`, consumers of your component library will interact with the proxy instead of the original `count` ref.

5. Use the component in another app
Now you can import and use the component in another Vue.js app.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <MyCounter />
    <p>Value: {{ myCount }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import MyCounter, { count } from 'path-to-your-component-library';

const myCount = count;
</script>
```

By importing the `count` proxy from the component library, you can use it directly in your app.

Using the Proxy Design Pattern with Vue.js 3 and script setup allows you to provide a controlled and customizable interface for your component library, enabling consumers to work with the component's internals in a more structured way.
