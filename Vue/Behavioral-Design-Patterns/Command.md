# Command

The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. In the context of a Vue.js component library with script setup, the Command Pattern can be useful for encapsulating and abstracting various operations that consumers can trigger on components.

Let's see how to implement the Command Design Pattern in a Vue.js component library using Vue.js version 3 with script setup.

1. Set up the Component Library
As before, start by creating a new Vue.js project or navigating to an existing project that serves as your component library.

2. Install Vue.js version 3
Ensure you have Vue.js version 3 installed in your project. You can install it using npm or yarn.

3. Create the component with script setup
In your component file, use the script setup syntax to define your component.

Let's create an example of a simple button component that uses the Command Pattern to allow consumers to define custom actions when the button is clicked:

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="executeCommand">{{ label }}</button>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const label = 'Click Me';

// Define a command ref to hold the action to be executed on click
const command = ref(() => {}); // Default no-op command

// Function to set the command
const setCommand = (cmd) => {
  command.value = cmd;
};

// Function to execute the command
const executeCommand = () => {
  command.value();
};
</script>
```

In this example, we use the `ref` function to create a reactive reference `command`, which will hold the action to be executed when the button is clicked. We also have a `setCommand` function to set the command from the consuming code, and `executeCommand` to run the assigned command when the button is clicked.

4. Export the setCommand function
To make the `setCommand` function accessible outside the component, export it from the script setup block.

```vue
<script setup>
// ...

export { setCommand };
</script>
```

5. Use the component in another app
Now you can import and use the component in another Vue.js app.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <MyButton :label="buttonLabel" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import MyButton, { setCommand } from 'path-to-your-component-library';

const buttonLabel = 'Execute Custom Command';

// Define a custom command to be executed when the button is clicked
const customCommand = () => {
  console.log('Custom command executed!');
};

// Set the custom command on the button
setCommand(customCommand);
</script>
```

In this example, we import the `setCommand` function from the component library and use it to set a custom command on the `MyButton` component. When the button is clicked, it will execute the assigned custom command.

Using the Command Design Pattern in a Vue.js component library can help create more flexible and customizable components, where consumers can define specific actions to be executed when certain events occur.
