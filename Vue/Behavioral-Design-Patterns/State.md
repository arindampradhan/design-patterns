# State

In Vue.js version 3 with the `script setup` syntax, you can implement the State Design Pattern in a component library to manage the internal state of a component in a structured and organized manner. The State pattern allows a component to change its behavior when its internal state changes, without needing to change its class or structure.

To implement the State Design Pattern in Vue.js, you can use the Composition API to define reactive state variables and methods that represent the different states of the component. Then, you can switch between these states based on certain conditions or triggers.

Here's an example of how you can implement the State Design Pattern in a Vue.js component using the `script setup` syntax:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your component template here -->
    <p v-if="currentState === 'initial'">Initial state</p>
    <p v-else-if="currentState === 'loading'">Loading state...</p>
    <p v-else-if="currentState === 'error'">Error state: {{ errorMessage }}</p>
    <p v-else-if="currentState === 'success'">Success state: {{ data }}</p>
    <button @click="fetchData" v-if="currentState === 'initial'">Fetch Data</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  // Import any necessary functions or objects from your component library
  import { ref, computed } from 'vue';

  // State variables
  const currentState = ref('initial'); // Possible values: 'initial', 'loading', 'error', 'success'
  const data = ref(null);
  const errorMessage = ref('');

  // Method to fetch data (simulate an asynchronous operation)
  async function fetchData() {
    currentState.value = 'loading';
    try {
      // Simulate an API call
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const responseData = await response.json();
      data.value = responseData;
      currentState.value = 'success';
    } catch (error) {
      errorMessage.value = error.message;
      currentState.value = 'error';
    }
  }
</script>
```

In this example, we have a simple component that demonstrates different states: 'initial', 'loading', 'error', and 'success'. When the component is in the 'initial' state, it displays a "Fetch Data" button, and when clicked, it transitions to the 'loading' state while simulating an asynchronous data fetch. Upon successful or failed data retrieval, it switches to the corresponding 'success' or 'error' state, displaying the fetched data or an error message, respectively.

By using the State Design Pattern, your Vue.js component library can manage complex component behaviors more effectively. It allows you to encapsulate the different states and their transitions within the component, making it easier to maintain and understand the component's behavior under various circumstances. The Composition API, in combination with the `script setup` syntax, provides a powerful way to implement this pattern while keeping your code concise and organized.
