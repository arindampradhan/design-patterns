# Mediator

In Vue.js version 3 with the `script setup` syntax, you can implement the Mediator Design Pattern in a component library to facilitate communication and coordination between multiple components without them directly referencing each other. The Mediator acts as a central hub that enables components to communicate through it, reducing direct dependencies and promoting a more loosely coupled architecture.

To implement the Mediator Design Pattern in Vue.js, you can use the Vue instance itself as the mediator, as it serves as the central communication hub between components. Components can emit events or call methods on the Vue instance, and other components can listen to these events or respond to the method calls.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Mediator Design Pattern in a Vue.js component using the `script setup` syntax:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your component template here -->
    <button @click="sendMessage">Send Message</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  // Import any necessary functions or objects from your component library
  import { onMounted } from 'vue';

  // Register the component with the mediator
  onMounted(() => {
    mediator.registerComponent(sendMessage);
  });

  // Method to send a message to other components through the mediator
  function sendMessage() {
    // Perform some logic here to prepare the message
    const message = "Hello, other components!";

    // Send the message through the mediator
    mediator.sendMessage(message);
  }
</script>
```

In this example, we have a simple component with a button that triggers the `sendMessage` function when clicked. The `sendMessage` function prepares a message and sends it through the `mediator`. The `mediator` is an object or instance that acts as the central hub for communication between components.

In other components, you can listen to the messages sent by the mediator:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your component template here -->
    <p v-if="receivedMessage">{{ receivedMessage }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  // Import any necessary functions or objects from your component library
  import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

  // Local state to store the received message
  const receivedMessage = ref('');

  // Register the component with the mediator
  onMounted(() => {
    mediator.registerComponent(receiveMessage);
  });

  // Method to handle received messages from the mediator
  function receiveMessage(message) {
    // Process the received message
    receivedMessage.value = message;
  }
</script>
```

In this example, the `receiveMessage` function is registered with the mediator during the `onMounted` lifecycle hook. When other components call `mediator.sendMessage`, this component will receive the message and update its local state (`receivedMessage`) accordingly.

By using the Mediator Design Pattern, you promote a decoupled and flexible architecture for your component library, as components don't directly interact with each other, but instead, they communicate through the mediator, making it easier to manage and extend the communication between components.
