# Chain of Responsibility

In Vue.js version 3 with the `script setup` syntax, you can implement the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in a component library to handle requests or events through a chain of processing steps. This pattern allows you to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver, giving multiple components the opportunity to handle the request in a sequence until it is appropriately processed.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in a Vue.js component using the `script setup` syntax:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your component template here -->
    <button @click="handleClick">Click Me</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  // Import any necessary functions or objects from your component library
  import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

  // Chain of responsibility handler function
  const handleButtonClick = ref(null);

  // Register the handler function to handle the click event
  onMounted(() => {
    handleButtonClick.value = handleFirstClick;
  });

  // Click event handler
  function handleClick() {
    if (handleButtonClick.value) {
      handleButtonClick.value();
    }
  }

  // First handler in the chain
  function handleFirstClick() {
    // Perform some logic here, and if the condition is met, pass the request to the next handler
    if (/* some condition */) {
      handleSecondClick();
    } else {
      // Handle the click event here
    }
  }

  // Second handler in the chain
  function handleSecondClick() {
    // Perform some logic here, and if the condition is met, pass the request to the next handler
    if (/* some condition */) {
      handleThirdClick();
    } else {
      // Handle the click event here
    }
  }

  // Third handler in the chain
  function handleThirdClick() {
    // Perform some logic here, and if the condition is met, pass the request to the next handler
    if (/* some condition */) {
      // You can add more handlers if needed, or end the chain here
    } else {
      // Handle the click event here
    }
  }
</script>
```

In this example, we have a component with a button that triggers the `handleClick` function when clicked. The `handleButtonClick` ref is used to store the current handler function. The `onMounted` lifecycle hook sets the initial handler function to `handleFirstClick`. Each handler function checks a certain condition, and if it's not met, it can handle the click event; otherwise, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.

By implementing the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern, you create a flexible and dynamic way to handle events or requests in a chain of processing steps. This allows you to add or modify handlers easily and promotes decoupling between the sender and the receiver of the request, making your component library more maintainable and extensible.
