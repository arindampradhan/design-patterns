# Memento

The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object's state to be captured and restored later without exposing its internal structure. In the context of a Vue.js component library with script setup, the Memento Pattern can be used to implement undo/redo functionality, where users can save the state of a component and revert to previous states when needed.

To implement the Memento Design Pattern in a Vue.js component library using Vue.js version 3 with script setup, we need to create a mechanism to store and restore the state of the component.

Let's create a simple example of a counter component that uses the Memento Pattern to save and restore its state:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
    <button @click="undo">Undo</button>
    <button @click="redo">Redo</button>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

const count = ref(0);
const history = ref([]);

// Function to increment the count
const increment = () => {
  const currentState = count.value;
  const newState = currentState + 1;
  history.value.push(currentState);
  count.value = newState;
};

// Function to undo the last action
const undo = () => {
  if (history.value.length > 0) {
    const prevState = history.value.pop();
    count.value = prevState;
  }
};

// Function to redo the last undone action
const redo = () => {
  if (history.value.length > 0) {
    const nextState = history.value.pop();
    count.value = nextState;
  }
};

// Save initial state on component mount
onMounted(() => {
  history.value.push(count.value);
});
</script>
```

In this example, we have a simple counter component with three buttons: "Increment," "Undo," and "Redo." The `count` ref holds the current count value, and the `history` ref is an array that stores previous states of the count.

The `increment` function is called when the "Increment" button is clicked, which increases the count and saves the current state in the `history` array.

The `undo` and `redo` functions allow users to revert to previous states or redo previously undone actions by popping states from the `history` array.

The initial state is saved in the `history` array when the component is mounted using the `onMounted` lifecycle hook.

When using this component in another app, you will get a counter with undo/redo functionality.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <MyCounter />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import MyCounter from 'path-to-your-component-library';
</script>
```

By implementing the Memento Pattern, you provide a way for consumers of your Vue.js component library to manage and control the state of the component, enabling undo/redo functionality and giving them more control over their user experience.
