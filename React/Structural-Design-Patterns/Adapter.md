# Adapter

In a React component library, you can implement the Adapter Design Pattern to make incompatible components work together by providing a wrapper or adapter component that converts the interface of one component into another. The Adapter pattern allows you to reuse existing components without modifying their code or interface.

To implement the Adapter Design Pattern in React, you can create a new component that acts as an adapter and uses the incompatible component internally, translating its interface into a compatible one that can be used by other components.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Adapter Design Pattern in a React component library:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Incompatible component with a different interface
const IncompatibleComponent = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <p>ID: {data.id}</p>
    <p>Name: {data.name}</p>
  </div>
);

// Adapter component that converts the interface of IncompatibleComponent into a compatible one
const AdapterComponent = ({ item }) => {
  const adaptedData = {
    id: item.id,
    name: item.title, // Convert 'title' to 'name'
  };

  return <IncompatibleComponent data={adaptedData} />;
};

const AdapterComponentLibrary = () => {
  const item = { id: 1, title: 'Item 1' };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Adapter Pattern in React</h1>
      <AdapterComponent item={item} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default AdapterComponentLibrary;
```

In this example, we have an `IncompatibleComponent` that has a different interface (it expects a prop named `data` with `id` and `name` properties). However, we want to use `item` instead of `data` in our component library. To make it compatible, we create an `AdapterComponent` that takes `item` as a prop, adapts it to match the expected `data` interface, and renders the `IncompatibleComponent` with the adapted data.

When you render the `AdapterComponentLibrary`, it will display the `IncompatibleComponent` wrapped in the `AdapterComponent`, effectively adapting the interface of the `item` prop to be compatible with the `IncompatibleComponent`.

By implementing the Adapter Design Pattern in this way, you can reuse existing components that have incompatible interfaces in your React component library. This allows you to integrate third-party or legacy components without modifying their code, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
