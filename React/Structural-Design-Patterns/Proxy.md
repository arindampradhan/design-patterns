# Proxy

In a React component library, you can implement the Proxy Design Pattern to control the access to components and add extra functionalities to them without modifying their code directly. The Proxy pattern allows you to create a surrogate or placeholder component that acts as an intermediary between the client and the actual component.

To implement the Proxy Design Pattern in React, you can create a proxy component that wraps the actual component. The proxy component can intercept requests to the actual component and perform additional tasks before or after forwarding the requests.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Proxy Design Pattern in a React component library:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Actual component that the proxy will control access to
const ActualComponent = ({ text }) => {
  console.log('Rendering ActualComponent');
  return <div>{text}</div>;
};

// Proxy component that controls access to the ActualComponent
const ProxyComponent = ({ text }) => {
  // Additional functionality can be added here before rendering the actual component.
  console.log('ProxyComponent is rendering');

  return <ActualComponent text={text} />;

  // Additional functionality can be added here after rendering the actual component.
};

const ProxyComponentLibrary = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Proxy Pattern in React</h1>
      <ProxyComponent text="Hello from Proxy" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProxyComponentLibrary;
```

In this example, we have an `ActualComponent` that represents the actual component we want to control access to. Then, we create a `ProxyComponent` that acts as a proxy for the `ActualComponent`. The `ProxyComponent` wraps the `ActualComponent` and can perform additional tasks before and after rendering the actual component. In this case, we simply log some messages to the console to demonstrate the proxy behavior.

When you render the `ProxyComponentLibrary`, you'll notice that the `ProxyComponent` controls access to the `ActualComponent` by adding the additional logging messages.

By implementing the Proxy Design Pattern in this way, you can control access to components in your React component library and add extra functionalities to them without modifying their original code. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to implement features like lazy loading, caching, access control, or logging for components in a non-intrusive way.
