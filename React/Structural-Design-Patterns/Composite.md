# Composite

In a React component library, you can implement the Composite Design Pattern to treat individual components and composite components (components containing other components) uniformly. The Composite pattern allows you to compose complex component hierarchies in a tree-like structure, where each node in the tree can be either a single component or a composite component (container of other components).

To implement the Composite Design Pattern in React, you can create a base component that defines the common interface for both individual components and composite components. The composite component will contain other components as its children, and the leaf components will represent individual elements or components.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Composite Design Pattern in a React component library:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Base component interface for both individual components and composite components
const BaseComponent = ({ children }) => {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
};

// Leaf component (Individual component)
const LeafComponent = ({ text }) => {
  return <p>{text}</p>;
};

// Composite component (Container component)
const CompositeComponent = ({ title, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

const CompositeComponentLibrary = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Composite Pattern in React</h1>
      {/* Individual components */}
      <BaseComponent>
        <LeafComponent text="Leaf 1" />
        <LeafComponent text="Leaf 2" />
      </BaseComponent>

      {/* Composite components */}
      <BaseComponent>
        <CompositeComponent title="Composite 1">
          <LeafComponent text="Leaf 3" />
          <LeafComponent text="Leaf 4" />
        </CompositeComponent>
        <CompositeComponent title="Composite 2">
          <LeafComponent text="Leaf 5" />
          <LeafComponent text="Leaf 6" />
        </CompositeComponent>
      </BaseComponent>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CompositeComponentLibrary;
```

In this example, we have a `BaseComponent` that acts as the common interface for both individual components (`LeafComponent`) and composite components (`CompositeComponent`). The `LeafComponent` represents an individual component (a leaf node in the tree), and the `CompositeComponent` represents a container component that can contain other components (composite nodes).

When you render the `CompositeComponentLibrary`, it will display a tree-like structure where you have individual components (`LeafComponent`) and composite components (`CompositeComponent`). The `BaseComponent` acts as the root node of the tree, and its children can be either leaf components or composite components.

By implementing the Composite Design Pattern in this way, you can build complex component hierarchies in your React component library in a flexible and uniform manner. The Composite pattern allows you to treat individual components and composite components uniformly, making it easier to work with complex structures and promoting code reuse and maintainability.
