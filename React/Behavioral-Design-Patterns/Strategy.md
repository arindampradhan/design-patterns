# Strategy

In a React component library, you can implement the Strategy Design Pattern to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable. The Strategy pattern allows you to select a specific algorithm at runtime without the client components being aware of the differences between them, promoting flexibility and reusability.

To implement the Strategy Design Pattern in React, you can use higher-order components (HOCs) or render props to encapsulate the different strategies (algorithms) and allow client components to switch between them.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Strategy Design Pattern in a React component library using higher-order components (HOCs):

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Strategy components (algorithms)
const StrategyA = ({ value }) => <p>Strategy A: {value * 2}</p>;
const StrategyB = ({ value }) => <p>Strategy B: {value * value}</p>;

// Higher-order components (HOCs) that wrap the strategy components
const withStrategyA = (WrappedComponent) => ({ value }) => (
  <WrappedComponent value={value} strategy="A" />
);

const withStrategyB = (WrappedComponent) => ({ value }) => (
  <WrappedComponent value={value} strategy="B" />
);

// Component that selects the strategy based on a prop
const StrategySelector = ({ value, strategy }) => {
  if (strategy === 'A') {
    return <StrategyA value={value} />;
  } else if (strategy === 'B') {
    return <StrategyB value={value} />;
  }
  return null;
};

// Component that uses the strategies based on user input
const StrategyComponent = ({ value, selectedStrategy }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Strategy Pattern in React</h1>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => value = parseInt(e.target.value)}
      />
      {selectedStrategy(value)}
    </div>
  );
};

// Usage of the StrategyComponent with different strategies
const ComponentWithStrategyA = withStrategyA(StrategyComponent);
const ComponentWithStrategyB = withStrategyB(StrategyComponent);

const StrategyComponentLibrary = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ComponentWithStrategyA />
      <ComponentWithStrategyB />
    </div>
  );
};

export default StrategyComponentLibrary;
```

In this example, we have two strategy components (`StrategyA` and `StrategyB`) that represent different algorithms. We then create higher-order components (`withStrategyA` and `withStrategyB`) to wrap the strategy components and allow them to be passed as props to the `StrategyComponent`.

The `StrategySelector` component receives the `value` and `strategy` as props and renders the selected strategy based on the `strategy` prop.

The `StrategyComponent` component is the main component that uses the strategies based on user input. It receives the `value` and `selectedStrategy` as props and renders the selected strategy component based on the user input.

By implementing the Strategy Design Pattern using higher-order components, you provide a flexible and reusable way to switch between different algorithms in your React component library. Client components can easily switch between different strategies without needing to know the details of each algorithm, promoting a more maintainable and adaptable architecture.
