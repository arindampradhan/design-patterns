# Chain of Responsibility

In a React component library, you can implement the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern to process or handle requests or events through a chain of processing steps. The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver, and each processing step in the chain can choose to handle the request or pass it to the next step in the chain.

To implement the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in React, you can create a chain of components, each responsible for processing the request in a certain way. If a component can't handle the request, it can pass it to the next component in the chain until the request is appropriately processed.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in a React component library:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// First handler component in the chain
const FirstHandler = ({ value, onHandled }) => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    // Perform some logic here, and if the condition is met, handle the request
    if (value >= 0) {
      onHandled('Positive Value');
    } else {
      // Pass the request to the next component in the chain
      onHandled(null);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Check Positive</button>;
};

// Second handler component in the chain
const SecondHandler = ({ value, onHandled }) => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    // Perform some logic here, and if the condition is met, handle the request
    if (value % 2 === 0) {
      onHandled('Even Value');
    } else {
      // Pass the request to the next component in the chain
      onHandled(null);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Check Even</button>;
};

// Third handler component in the chain
const ThirdHandler = ({ value, onHandled }) => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    // Perform some logic here, and if the condition is met, handle the request
    if (value < 10) {
      onHandled('Value Less Than 10');
    } else {
      // Pass the request to the next component in the chain
      onHandled(null);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Check Less Than 10</button>;
};

const ChainOfResponsibilityComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  const [result, setResult] = useState('');

  // Method to handle the request based on the result from the components in the chain
  const handleRequest = (result) => {
    if (result) {
      setResult(result);
    } else {
      setResult('Request Not Handled');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Chain of Responsibility Pattern in React</h1>
      <input type="number" value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(parseInt(e.target.value))} />
      <FirstHandler value={value} onHandled={handleRequest} />
      <SecondHandler value={value} onHandled={handleRequest} />
      <ThirdHandler value={value} onHandled={handleRequest} />
      <p>Result: {result}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChainOfResponsibilityComponent;
```

In this example, we have three handler components (`FirstHandler`, `SecondHandler`, and `ThirdHandler`) in the chain. Each handler component checks the value and handles the request based on certain conditions. If a handler component can't handle the request, it passes the request to the next component in the chain by calling the `onHandled` callback with a `null` value. The chain of components is set up in the `ChainOfResponsibilityComponent`, and the result is displayed based on the response from the handler components.

By implementing the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern, you can create a flexible and dynamic way to handle requests or events in a chain of processing steps in your React component library. This allows you to add or modify handlers easily and promotes decoupling between the sender and the receiver of the request, making your component library more maintainable and extensible.
