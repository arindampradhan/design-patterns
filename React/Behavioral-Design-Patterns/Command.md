# Command

In a React component library, you can implement the Command Design Pattern to allow users to encapsulate and parameterize operations or actions on components, making them more flexible and customizable. The Command Pattern can be useful when you want to abstract the logic behind user interactions, enabling consumers to define custom actions without directly modifying the component's code.

Let's see how you can implement the Command Design Pattern in a React component library:

1. Set up the Component Library
Start by creating a new React component library project or use an existing one.

2. Create the Command Component
Create a command component that represents an action that can be executed by a consumer. The command component should accept a function as a prop that will be executed when the command is triggered.

```jsx
// Command.js
import React from 'react';

const Command = ({ action, children }) => {
  return <button onClick={action}>{children}</button>;
};

export default Command;
```

3. Implement the Component with Commands
Now, you can implement your component that uses the commands provided by the users. In this example, let's create a simple counter component with increment and reset commands:

```jsx
// Counter.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Command from './Command';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  };

  const reset = () => {
    setCount(0);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <Command action={increment}>Increment</Command>
      <Command action={reset}>Reset</Command>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

In this example, we create a `Counter` component that maintains the state `count`. We define `increment` and `reset` functions as the actions to be executed when the corresponding commands are triggered.

4. Use the Component Library in Another App
Now, you can publish your component library or use it in another React app. To use the `Counter` component, consumers can customize the behavior by providing their own actions:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Counter from 'path-to-your-component-library/Counter';

const CustomApp = () => {
  const customIncrement = () => {
    console.log('Custom Increment');
    // Add your custom increment logic here
  };

  const customReset = () => {
    console.log('Custom Reset');
    // Add your custom reset logic here
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      <Counter>
        {/* Customize actions using inline arrow functions */}
        <Command action={() => customIncrement()}>Custom Increment</Command>
        <Command action={() => customReset()}>Custom Reset</Command>
      </Counter>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CustomApp;
```

In this example, we use the `Counter` component and provide custom actions for increment and reset using inline arrow functions.

By implementing the Command Design Pattern in your React component library, you allow users to encapsulate and parameterize operations on your components, providing them with more flexibility and customization options. This can lead to more reusable and adaptable components within your library.
