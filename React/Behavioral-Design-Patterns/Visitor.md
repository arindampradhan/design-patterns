# Visitor

The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors or operations to a group of related objects without modifying their code. It achieves this by separating the operation logic from the object structure. In a React component library, you can implement the Visitor Pattern to add new functionality to components without directly modifying their source code.

To implement the Visitor Design Pattern in a React component library, we can use higher-order components (HOCs) or render props to separate the component structure from the operation logic.

Let's see how you can implement the Visitor Design Pattern using HOCs in a React component library:

1. Set up the Component Library
Start by creating a new React component library project or use an existing one.

2. Create the Visitor Component
Create a Visitor component that will be used to add new functionality or operations to other components. The Visitor component should be a higher-order component that takes a component as input and returns a new component with additional functionality.

```jsx
// Visitor.js
import React from 'react';

const Visitor = (WrappedComponent) => {
  const newProps = {
    additionalProp: 'Value from Visitor',
  };

  return <WrappedComponent {...newProps} />;
};

export default Visitor;
```

3. Create a Component to Visit
Create a component in your component library that you want to add new functionality to. This component should be a regular functional or class component.

```jsx
// MyComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Original Component</p>
      <p>Additional Prop: {props.additionalProp}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

4. Use the Visitor in Your App Component
Now, you can use the Visitor component to add new functionality to the `MyComponent` component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Visitor from 'path-to-your-component-library/Visitor';
import MyComponent from 'path-to-your-component-library/MyComponent';

const App = () => {
  const MyComponentWithVisitor = Visitor(MyComponent);

  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponentWithVisitor />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we create a `MyComponent` component and a `Visitor` component (higher-order component). The `Visitor` component takes `MyComponent` as input and returns a new component with additional props.

By using the Visitor Design Pattern with higher-order components, you can add new functionality or behavior to existing components without modifying their source code. This approach promotes separation of concerns and allows you to create a more modular and extensible React component library.
