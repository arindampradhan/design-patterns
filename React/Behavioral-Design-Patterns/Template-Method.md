# Template Method

In a React component library, you can implement the Template Method Design Pattern to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a component while allowing certain steps to be overridden by subclasses (or child components). The Template Method pattern enables you to define a common structure for components while allowing them to have variations in certain parts of the algorithm.

To implement the Template Method Design Pattern in React, you can create a base component that contains the common structure (the template) and provides hooks (methods) that child components can override to customize specific steps of the algorithm.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Template Method Design Pattern in a React component library:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Base component with the template method
class BaseComponent extends React.Component {
  // Template method with the common algorithm structure
  templateMethod() {
    this.step1();
    this.step2();
  }

  // Step 1: To be implemented by child components
  step1() {
    throw new Error('Step 1 must be implemented by child components.');
  }

  // Step 2: To be implemented by child components
  step2() {
    throw new Error('Step 2 must be implemented by child components.');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.templateMethod()}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// ConcreteComponentA that extends the BaseComponent and overrides step1 and step2
class ConcreteComponentA extends BaseComponent {
  step1() {
    console.log('ConcreteComponentA: Step 1 executed.');
  }

  step2() {
    console.log('ConcreteComponentA: Step 2 executed.');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Concrete Component A</h1>
        {super.render()}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// ConcreteComponentB that extends the BaseComponent and overrides step1 and step2
class ConcreteComponentB extends BaseComponent {
  step1() {
    console.log('ConcreteComponentB: Step 1 executed differently.');
  }

  step2() {
    console.log('ConcreteComponentB: Step 2 executed differently.');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Concrete Component B</h1>
        {super.render()}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const TemplateMethodComponentLibrary = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ConcreteComponentA />
      <ConcreteComponentB />
    </div>
  );
};

export default TemplateMethodComponentLibrary;
```

In this example, we have a `BaseComponent` class that serves as the template for the algorithm. It defines the `templateMethod` that contains the common algorithm structure, which consists of `step1` and `step2`. Both `step1` and `step2` are abstract methods that are meant to be overridden by child components.

We then create two concrete components (`ConcreteComponentA` and `ConcreteComponentB`) that extend the `BaseComponent` and provide their implementations of `step1` and `step2`.

When you render the `TemplateMethodComponentLibrary`, it will display the two concrete components (`ConcreteComponentA` and `ConcreteComponentB`), and when each of them is rendered, the corresponding steps of the algorithm will be executed.

By implementing the Template Method Design Pattern in this way, you can define a common structure for components in your React component library while allowing each component to provide its specific implementations for certain steps of the algorithm. This promotes code reuse, maintainability, and flexibility in your component library.
