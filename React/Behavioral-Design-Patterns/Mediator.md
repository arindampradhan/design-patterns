# Mediator

In a React component library, you can implement the Mediator Design Pattern to facilitate communication and coordination between multiple components without them directly referencing each other. The Mediator acts as a central hub that enables components to communicate through it, reducing direct dependencies and promoting a more loosely coupled architecture.

To implement the Mediator Design Pattern in React, you can create a mediator component that serves as the central communication hub. Components can communicate with each other by sending messages or triggering events through the mediator.

Here's an example of how you can implement the Mediator Design Pattern in a React component library:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Mediator component
const Mediator = ({ children }) => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  // Method to send a message from one component to another through the mediator
  const sendMessage = (message) => {
    setMessage(message);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {React.Children.map(children, (child) =>
        React.cloneElement(child, {
          sendMessage,
          message,
        })
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

// ComponentA communicates with ComponentB through the mediator
const ComponentA = ({ sendMessage, message }) => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    // Send a message to ComponentB through the mediator
    sendMessage('Hello from Component A!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Component A</h2>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Send Message</button>
      <p>Message received by Component A: {message}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// ComponentB communicates with ComponentA through the mediator
const ComponentB = ({ sendMessage, message }) => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    // Send a message to ComponentA through the mediator
    sendMessage('Hello from Component B!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Component B</h2>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Send Message</button>
      <p>Message received by Component B: {message}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const MediatorComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Mediator Pattern in React</h1>
      <Mediator>
        <ComponentA />
        <ComponentB />
      </Mediator>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MediatorComponent;
```

In this example, we have a `Mediator` component that acts as the central hub for communication between `ComponentA` and `ComponentB`. The `Mediator` component passes the `sendMessage` function and the `message` state to its child components.

`ComponentA` and `ComponentB` communicate with each other through the `sendMessage` function provided by the mediator. When one component sends a message, the mediator updates the `message` state, which is then displayed by both components.

By implementing the Mediator Design Pattern, you promote a decoupled and flexible architecture for your React component library. Components don't directly interact with each other, but instead, they communicate through the mediator, making it easier to manage and extend the communication between components. This pattern also reduces tight coupling and improves maintainability and reusability of your components.
