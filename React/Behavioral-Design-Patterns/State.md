# State

The State Design Pattern in React is used to manage and encapsulate the state of a component in a more structured and organized way. It allows the component to change its behavior when its internal state changes, without directly exposing the state to the component's consumers.

To implement the State Design Pattern in a React component library, you can use either the traditional state management approach using React's `useState` hook or use a state management library like Redux or Mobx to manage the state of the components.

Let's see how you can implement the State Design Pattern using React's `useState` hook:

1. Set up the Component Library
Start by creating a new React component library project or use an existing one.

2. Create the Component with State
Create a component and use the `useState` hook to manage its state. The state can be an object that contains various properties representing different states of the component.

```jsx
// ToggleButton.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ToggleButton = () => {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  const toggle = () => {
    setIsOn((prevIsOn) => !prevIsOn);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={toggle}>
      {isOn ? 'Turn Off' : 'Turn On'}
    </button>
  );
};

export default ToggleButton;
```

3. Use the Component Library in Your App Component
Now, you can use the `ToggleButton` component from your component library in your app component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ToggleButton from 'path-to-your-component-library/ToggleButton';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Toggle Button Example</h2>
      <ToggleButton />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we have a `ToggleButton` component that manages its state using the `useState` hook. When the button is clicked, the `toggle` function is called, which updates the state and causes the component to re-render with the updated state.

By using the State Design Pattern with React's `useState` hook, you encapsulate the state of the component and allow it to change its behavior based on its internal state. This approach makes it easier to manage the state of the component and provides a more controlled and organized way to handle different states and behaviors within your component library.
